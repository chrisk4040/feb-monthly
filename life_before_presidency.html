        <h2 class="my-3 text-danger">Early Career and Military Engagements</h2>
        <p>Washington began his career as a land surveyor at the age of 16, gaining knowledge of the Virginia frontier,
            which would later aid his military leadership. He served as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia
            during the French and Indian War (1754â€“1763), where his experiences shaped his military tactics. His first
            military engagement at Fort Necessity earned him recognition, and he later served as an aide-de-camp to
            General Braddock during the Battle of Monongahela, helping rally British forces after Braddock's death.</p>

        <h2 class="text-info">Commander-in-Chief and Revolutionary War</h2>
        <p>After the battles of Lexington and Concord, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental
            Army by the Second Continental Congress in 1775. He took command during the Siege of Boston, forcing the
            British to evacuate in March 1776. His bold decision to cross the Delaware River on Christmas night and
            attack the Hessian forces in Trenton resulted in a significant victory, boosting morale for the Continental
            Army. Washington's leadership during the harsh winter at Valley Forge helped transform the army into a more
            disciplined force.</p>

        <h2 class="my-3 text-danger">Alliances and Victories</h2>
        <p>Washington played a crucial role in strengthening ties with France, which provided military and financial
            support to the colonial cause. His leadership was pivotal in the victory at Saratoga, convincing France to
            formally ally with the United States. Washington's strategic management during the Southern Campaign and the
            Siege of Yorktown ultimately led to British defeat and the end of the Revolutionary War. After the war, he
            famously resigned his commission, setting a precedent for civilian control of the military.</p>
